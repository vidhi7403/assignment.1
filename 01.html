Q:1 What is jQuery?
ANS:jQuery is a small, light-weight and fast JavaScript library. It is cross-platform and supports different types of browsers. It is also referred as ?write less do more? because it takes a lot of common tasks that requires many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and binds them into methods that can be called with a single line of code whenever needed. It is also very useful to simplify a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

Q:2  How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in
Jquery, JQuery Animation?

ANS:When looking to GET a CSS property with jQuery’s .css method, jQuery will return the first matched element’s CSS properties. So, you will want to pay close attention to the jQuery selector used when requesting a CSS property. If you pass a class into the selector and a group of elements gets returned, jQuery’s .css method will only show CSS properties for the first matched element in the group of matched elements.
The addClass() or removeClass() methods are used to add the CSS classes when there is a need to add to our webpage when there is some event listener or to create some kind of effect.

In this article, let us see how can we add a CSS class or remove a CSS class in jQuery.
The jQuery animate() method is used to create custom animations.

Syntax:

$(selector).animate({params},speed,callback);
The required params parameter defines the CSS properties to be animated.

The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds.

The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the animation completes.

Syntax:

Adding a class:
$('selector').addClass(class_name);
Removing a class:
$('selector').removeClass(class_name);
Example: The following example adds a class that makes the background colour black when clicked on ADD CLASS button and also removes that added class when clicked on the REMOVE CLASS button.

There are tons of design trends you can use to get visitors to stop and pay attention to the main hero section on your home page. The only problem is that once a trend gets overplayed, it quickly loses that cool factor that made it so special in the beginning.

If you want to make sure your visitors take notice of what you’ve created as well as the messaging contained within it, you need to give them a reason to. A sliced-and-diced slider animation effect they won’t find anywhere else is a sure-fire way to do that.
